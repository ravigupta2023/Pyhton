# 1️⃣ Empty Function

# Write a function called process_data() that has no code inside it.
# Use pass so Python does not give an error.


def process_data():
    pass

# 2️⃣ Empty Loop

# Create a loop that iterates 10 times but does nothing inside the loop.
# Use pass.


for i in range(10):
    pass

# 3️⃣ Skip Planning Case

# Write an if statement:

# If the number is greater than 100, do nothing (use pass)
a = [1,2,3,4,4]
if a > 100:
    pass

    

# Otherwise print "Small number"

# 4️⃣ Using pass in Class

# Create an empty class named Employee using pass.

# 5️⃣ Try–Except with pass

# Write a code block:

# Try dividing a number by zero

# In the except block, use pass
# Program should not show any error.

# 6️⃣ If–Else Skeleton

# Write an if-else structure where both blocks use pass.
# (Just the structure, nothing else.)

# 7️⃣ Placeholder for Future Code

# Write a function called calculate() that will do some logic later.
# For now, put only pass inside.

# 8️⃣ Combining pass with a Loop

# Loop through a list of names.
# If the name is "Ravi", do nothing using pass.
# Otherwise print the name.

# 9️⃣ Menu Program Skeleton

# Create this structure:

# 1. Add
# 2. Delete
# 3. Search
# 4. Exit


# For each option, just use pass (no logic yet).

# 🔟 Nested Structure

# Create nested loops and an if inside the inner loop.
# Use pass in at least one block.
